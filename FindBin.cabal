synopsis:           Locate directory of original program
description:        This module locates the full directory to the running program,
                    to allow the use of paths relative to it.
                    FindBin supports invocation of Haskell programs via "ghci",
                    via "runhaskell/runghc", as well as compiled as an executable.
